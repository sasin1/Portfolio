                  Originally from Nepal, I had no clue where life would take me or even
                  where to start. I was just floating through school until I met a friend
                  in middle school who was obsessed with hacking, web designing, and
                  developing. His enthusiasm sparked something in me, and that's how my
                  journey began. My very first project was creating forms in HTMLâ€”I was
                  over the moon about it (and yes, I'm still proud of that little
                  victory).
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 md:mb-4">
                  Later, I moved to Canada to pursue a diploma in computer programming.
                  Between the course materials and reconnecting with my childhood friend,
                  we started designing and developing websites together. Eventually, we
                  landed real clients and couldn't contain our excitement. We've worked
                  with businesses like Wevona, GCS Systems, Momo House, and Shree Brow Bar
                  (some of which expanded to places like the UK!). It's been a
                  rollercoaster of learning and growth, but I'm still on the ride,
                  exploring new programming languages and chasing that "aha!" moment.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-3 md:mb-4">
                  Outside the tech world, I love being active. You'll find me playing
                  soccer and cricket outdoors or gaming indoors with Fortnite and Rocket
                  League. Netflix? That's my chill buddy. And food? Oh, trying new
                  cuisines is practically my hobby. I'm also a travel enthusiast, always
                  ready to pack my bags for the next adventure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In short, I'm a curious coder, a food fanatic, a travel junkie, and a
                  Netflix binge-watcher all rolled into one. Life is my sandbox, and I'm
                  here to explore every corner of it. Let's just say I'm the type of
                  person who will try to debug code, devour a pizza, and plan a tripâ€”all
                  at the same time, probably in that order. ðŸ˜Š
